            <div class="accordion-body">Props (short for "properties") are read-only data that are passed from a parent component to a child component. State, on the other hand, is mutable data that is managed and updated within a component. It represents the component's internal state and can be changed based on user interactions or other factors. In summary, props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, while state is used to manage data and behavior within a component. </div>

            How does useState work?

          <div id="flush-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
            <div class="accordion-body">the useState hook is used to add state to a functional component. It allows you to declare a state variable and update it using a function provided by React.
            When you call useState, it returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state. You can use array destructuring to assign names to these values.</div>

          <div id="flush-collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
            <div class="accordion-body">One common use case of useEffect is to manage the side effects of a component, such as updating the title of a webpage or subscribing to a WebSocket. By using useEffect, you can ensure that these side effects are only executed when needed, and are cleaned up when the component is unmounted.
            Another use case of useEffect is to manage the state of a component in response to certain events, such as keyboard or mouse events. By using useEffect with the appropriate dependencies, you can update the state of a component in response to these events, and ensure that the component is re-rendered with the updated state.
            Overall, the useEffect hook is a powerful tool for managing the side effects and state of a React component, and can be used for a wide range of purposes beyond fetching data.
